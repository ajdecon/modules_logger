{"tagline":"Log user activity for environment modules to MongoDB","body":"modules_logger\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nInspired by Jeff Layton's article on logging usage of environment modules,\r\nhttp://hpc.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Gathering-Data-on-Environment-Modules,\r\nand by Harvard's modules-usage project, https://github.com/fasrc/module-usage.\r\nAlso, I wanted to learn MongoDB, and data persistence for this project was\r\na good excuse. :)\r\n\r\nLogs all \"module\" commands, and keeps a running tally of how many times each\r\nmodule is loaded by a given user. Uses MongoDB for persistence. Requires pymongo.\r\n\r\n## To build and install an RPM (preferred) ##\r\n1. `python setup.py bdist_rpm`\r\n2. `sudo yum localinstall dist/modules-logger-0.1-1.noarch.rpm`\r\n\r\n## To install by hand: ##\r\n* Install and start MongoDB, and install pymongo. The relevant packages are in \r\nthe EPEL repository for EL6: installing \"mongodb\", \"mongodb-server\", and \r\n\"pymongo\" should be sufficient. The default configuration binds to 127.0.0.1, so \r\nyou may want to adjust the configuration to expose to other cluster nodes.\r\n* Put modules_logger and modules_usage into the PATH on your nodes (/usr/local/bin, \r\nfor example)\r\n* Put modules_logger.conf into /etc/, and edit the config appropriately.\r\n* Replace /etc/profile.d/modules.sh with the modules.sh.logger provided here.\r\n\r\n## TODO: ##\r\n* Add support for csh/tcsh\r\n* Add additional reporting functions besides \"how many times user X \r\nloaded each module\"\r\n* Detect failed loads?\r\n","name":"Modules logger","google":"UA-12576607-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
